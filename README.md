# tokyo-cms
Headless CMS that can easily be integrated in any website/webapp, made possible by Stencil webcomponents.

There are 3 parts:
### cms-core
The stencil components that will be responsible for content delivery. There will also be an editor (foowebsite.com/editor), where the client/webmaster can manager the content of the site.
